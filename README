thin-wall-topography
====================

Implementation of the thin-wall interpolation algorithm for interpolating high-resolution topography for use in numerical circulation models of the ocean and atmosphere.

The purpose of this repository is to promote and facilitate the use of this, or other interpolation methods, for objectively generating topographic files used by numerical circulation codes. I also hope this will become a catalyst for further development of the algorithm. Contributions are welcome. Consistent with the GPLv3 (see below) you can use this software, copy it, distribute it, etc. but all such versions must be also be provided under the GPLv3 (I'm no lawyer but I basically want you to be able to use this software).

How to cite
===========
This algoritm is due to be published in a scientific journal, Ocean Modelling (Elsevier), http://www.journals.elsevier.com/ocean-modelling/ . If you are publishing data or research that uses this software or algorithm, you should cite the original algorithm as follows:
 Adcroft, A., 2014: Representation of topography by porous barriers and objective interpolation of topographic data. Ocean Modelling, submitted.

What's what
===========
matlab/ has all the Matlab scripts (which is everything for time being).
python/ will contain python implementation
fortran/ will contain fortran-95 implementation
The python and fortran source codes are in the pipeline.
