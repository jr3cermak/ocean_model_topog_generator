# A tool set for creating model topography
This tool creates a model topography for a given horizontal model grid and a given observation dataset for height. It uses a recursive refine-sample-coarsen scheme to interpolate the observation dataset onto the model grid. 
This tool is based on the thin wall interpolation algorithm of Adcroft et.al. for interpolating high-resolution topography for use in numerical circulation models of the ocean and atmosphere which is hosted at https://github.com/adcroft/thin-wall-topography.
